# Reverse a string

* Difficulty - Beginner

Write a function that takes in a string as an input.

Return the string with its characters in the opposite order.

You can reverse the string in  place or with a new variable.

>NOTE: Try to solve this without using any built in string or array methods (split, reverse, join are all built in array methods). 

```js
reverseString('hello'); // 'olleh'
reverseString('world'); // 'dlrow'
```
